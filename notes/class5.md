# Themes in Software Craftsmanship
## Conquer complexity, conventions, and quality
Software engineer turns something complex and make it a story a 5 year old can understand
If I can't understand your house
#### 6 Things that reduce complexity in your code
- doc strings
- a comment above a block of code
- a test
- meaningful, short names
- consistent spacing
- small helper functions
- making things more generic
- lossly coupled functions and objectives
- telling a code store (comments turn into code )

### Conquering Complexity Technique
- Diving a system into subsystems at the architecture level so that your brain can focus on a smaller amount of the system at one time.
- Carefully defining class interface
- Preserving the abstraction represented by the class interface
* When your given 20 projects parts by your boss a day, that can be very hard if your not making subsystems and using your daily habits
- Avoiding global data
- Avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies because they are intellectually demanding.

- Avoiding deep nesting of loops and conditionals because they can be replaced by simpler control structures that burn up fewer gray cells.
- Carefully defining your approach to error
- The code is actually speaking back to us
- Tell me a good story with that code
- What do I need this one recipe to do? What is the input and what is the output?

### Examples of Convention
- indentation
- snake case - only in python
- camel case
- MVC
-
### What is one reason why you may break convention?
- If the convention is really old
- If it makes your code more readiable
- If your doing something unique
- When the convention limits the functionality of the program

### Where do you draw the line
- When it is documented
- It is arguing

### conventions
- CTO
- Lead Developer
- Designers (Style guide)

## Situation
- Pain point encouraged the conversation from development lead

### Pros
- eslint
- adds structure
- readability
- hazard prevention
    - no global variables
- predictability

### Cons
- time consuming
- overbearing if not kept in check

### Many companies in SF have conventions so that we won't have bad situation that would case us to lose trust

### Examples of Processes
- Agile:
    - like a process understand, design, build, deliver
    - we check in to make sure were buidling the right thing
- Waterfall

### Several processes we do to be the best software engineers we can be

#### If it feels like in your gut something is wrong, something is wrong

### Watch Out for Falling Rocks
- If your senior developers are saying nothing and are just looking at you
    - Refactoring code for easier comprehension
- Compiler warnings
    - Investigate and fix, don't ignore
- 0 things finished, 100 things started
    - Have an idea notebook

### Program into language
- Visual Studio

### Write programs for people, not computers

it done super fast

Refacator Activity
1. [x] Read the Refactor Rubric to understand high-quality
refactoring
2. [x] Choose project to refactor - Reviewed by Trucker
3. [x] Write your refactor plan
    - refactor routes
    - add comments
    - tell a story
    - get reed of things your not using (ex: objects)
    - Link to tracker
4. [ ] Refactor code:
    - Link to tracker
5. [ ] HW: Finish refactor Wed class we'll grade each other's work
