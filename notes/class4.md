# What do you think is examples of good software Quality?
- In Pinterest that always shows me more content when I stroll

- The color scheme is the same all through the product (Reliability)

- There is a tag for everything I want (Adaptability)

##Everyone loves things that works

# Workflow and Supply Chain is another word for microservices

# What makes good software
- Adaptability
- Robustness
- Accuracy
- Correctness
- Usability: on-boarding (learned how to use the software very quickly)
    - You will lose a user if your software takes more then half a second to load
- Efficiency
- Reliability
- Integrity

# Advice I give to software engineers:
- ## Don't write bugs
    - Users may submit a form but you may not have added your styles to the thank you page, that may look like a bug to the user

- I have built software accuracy but did not fufill the the objective (ex: this is well written software but I didn't tell you to write this)

## Your code is only as good as the test you write

## The words associated with good software can be used as a guide for making your software better after MVP

## Interal Characteristics
- Portable: runs on multiple platforms

- First job you will probably be assigned to fix tickets, its a way for higher ups to through you into the deep end and for you to learn how things work in the system

## Know the difference between loose compiling and tight compiling
## Write down why your doing something in your comments
    - tells you the intention of the group of code
        ```
        # iterate through animals to see which animals is in the lions den
        for animal in animals
        ```
## Our jobs is to communicate intention to the outside world

# I like working at Pinterest because they appreciate me added testability

# It is so good and important to talk to other engineers that you haven't talked to because everyone comes from a different place

# High Level Design - What it looks like 100 miles a away

# Low Level Design - What it looks like 10 inches a way

# Do n
## The act of articulating how your building the software makes you a better engineer -

## When you want to code something talk about someone who will write the test
    - You case say I'm thinking about writing this how would you test this

## Take feedback no matter how badly it is delivered

# Bugs are expensive and we have a process to get re

# Have a Quality Gate: before you release something
    - Identify what is good enough and what are perfect

# Read Code Complete for your first job

# Your output as a develper is very important and the person who signs your checks is watching that
-

# It is most expensi
