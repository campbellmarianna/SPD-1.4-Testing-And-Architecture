# Refactor Plan Pseudocode
# Input: first number, sign second number # 1, +, 1
# print String of first number sign second number # 1 + 1 = 2
# Processing
# Write a test based on the current program that you can test your implementation by
# check the inputs are valid
# Initialize variables
# first num
# second num
# total
# check if given sign matches other known signs
# then do the math with the sign it matches
# print using string templating to out the first, second num, total with equal sign
