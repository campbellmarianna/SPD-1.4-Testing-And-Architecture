## Senior Engineer
- I psueduocode all the time to get ideas out of my head

## Think, Pair Share
1. 3 things that would make me code faster:
    - already did the logic on paper
    - Tested it
    - Had psueduocode checked by another engineer
    - Plan out variables
    - We stand on the shoulders of giants
        - google others solutions

## If you code:
# The reduction in the number of bugs yields improvement in overall development time.

# One Link
## Collaboration
## Focused Goal

# Formal engineering techniques
- Interact with other programmers is required. (Remote put in extra effort to communicate)

## Collaboration reduces bugs

### Join a pack, stay in a pack and talk about code

## Psudeocode

##  The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear about what your trying to build

## Tools:

    - Use psudeo to describe what you
    - Always step back, write on paper with pencil when you have to create a new

    Step 1: Design a Class
        - Create  general design for the class.
        - Construct each routine within the class.
        - Review/test the whole class.

## As an engineer, I tell you trust your mind and your gut.
