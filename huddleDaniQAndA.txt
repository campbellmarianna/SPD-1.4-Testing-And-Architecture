- Who's in your squad?
    - I was only myself when working with clients
    - I had many burn't out periods in my career
- Apply code to some super cool creative projects you will always have a fun time
    - I was terrified (as a CTO I was okay with 0)
    - Github terectory 2012 on
- Being a Women in Tech
    - Even though I won multiple times, I was picked last
    - I was the spark that
    - I was tested 3 times as hard, but I grew 3 times as strong
    - The only way you grow as an engineer is by doing  (on shit I don't know this, but I know in my head I can do this - that is the boundary you work in)(Sherry Hill)
    - It was really enabling to see someone who looked like me during my first interview at Make School
    - Just doing tickets (fixing bugs) and make 130  -  you can do that some people find lots of satifaction
